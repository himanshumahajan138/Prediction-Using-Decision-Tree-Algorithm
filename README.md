# Data Science Internship Task 2 - [The Sparks Foundation](https://thesparksfoundationsingapore.org/)

# Prediction-Using-Decision-Tree-Algorithm

## Introduction
This repository contains the code and explanation for Task 2 of my Data Science internship at [The Sparks Foundation](https://thesparksfoundationsingapore.org/). In this task, I have analyzed the Iris dataset, a classic dataset often used in machine learning for classification tasks.

## About [The Sparks Foundation](https://thesparksfoundationsingapore.org/)
The Sparks Foundation is a non-profit organization committed to providing opportunities for students and professionals to develop skills in various fields, including data science and machine learning. They offer a range of tasks and projects to help individuals gain practical experience and knowledge in these domains.

## Project Overview
The project is a Python script that performs a comprehensive analysis of the Iris dataset. Here's an overview of what the code does:

- Imports necessary libraries for data analysis, visualization, and modeling.
- Loads the Iris dataset from a CSV file into a DataFrame and preprocesses the data.
- Explores the data, checks for null values, and handles outliers.
- Visualizes the relationships between variables.
- Splits the data into training and testing sets.
- Applies feature scaling to ensure consistent scales.
- Builds a Decision Tree Classifier model and evaluates its performance.
- Visualizes the Decision Tree for insights.

## Usage
To use this code and analyze the Iris dataset, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine: ```git clone https://github.com/himanshumahajan138/Prediction-Using-Decision-Tree-Algorithm```

2. Install the required libraries if you haven't already. You can use pip for this: ```pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn```

3. Download the Iris dataset (Iris.csv) and place it in the same directory as the script.

4. Run the script: ```python iris_analysis.py```

5. The script will perform data analysis, build a model, and display the results and visualizations.
